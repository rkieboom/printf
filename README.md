# printf
This project is a re-writing of the standard C printf function, with all the same specifiers and flags. It is intended to be used to understand how variadic arguments work.

## Specifiers
The following specifiers are supported by this project:

- c: Character
- s: String
- p: Pointer address
- d: Signed decimal integer
- i: Signed decimal integer
- u: Unsigned decimal integer
- x: Unsigned hexadecimal integer
- X: Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase)
- %: A % followed by another % will write a single % to the stream

## Flags
The following flags are supported:

- -: Left-justify within the given field width
- 0: Left-pads the number with zeroes (only when padding with zeroes is specified)
- .*: Precision
- #: Used with o, x or X specifiers the value is preceeded with 0, 0x or 0X respectively for values different than zero
- +: Forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for positive numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a - sign.

## Usage
The printf function can be used in the following way:

```
int printf(const char *format, ...);
```

Where format is a string that contains one or more of the specifiers and flags mentioned above.

For more information on usage and examples, please consult the project documentation.

Enjoy!
